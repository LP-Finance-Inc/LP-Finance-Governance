  LPFi emissions.

# xLPFi Token (Common Shares)

### Minting xLPFi

xLPFi can be minted by burning LPFi (1:1 ratio). Minted xLPFi is not redeemable and should be swapped to LPFi on market.

### xLPFi Staking

xLPFi can be staked to earn LPFi emissions. Unlike LPFi staking pool, protocol revenue is not shared. The emissions are set as 40,000 LPFi/year and the total allocation is 200,000 LPFi.

At this rate, LPFi emission would stop at year 6. Before the emission drains up, a  governance proposal would be made to decide if LPFi should be inflated (minted) to provide LPFi emissions.

In the future, xLPFi staking pool will receive bribes from other protocols. The details on bribing is not specified at the moment.

### Governance Parameters

Creating proposals and voting is possible on Realms. There are parameters set initially to match the circulating supply and expected engagements.

* **Vote Threshold Percentage**: 10% (At least 10% supply of xLPFi should be used to vote for the proposal to pass)
* **Minimum Token**: 500 xLPFi (At least x500 LPFi is needed to create a proposal)
* **Max Voting Time**: 3 days (Vote would be held for 3 days)

These parameters can be modified if the proposal passes.

### Common Governance Topics

Common governance topics on LP Finance are as follows

* Change LPFi Staking Revenue Distribution Configurations
* Change LPFi Unstaking Penalties
* Onboard zSOL-{token} LP from {x} DEX to zSOL LP Staking Pool
* Change zSOL Stability Fee
* Change Collateral Deposit Fee
* Manage DAO Treasury

If a proposal includes complex logic/changes on the program and LP Finance Development Team does not support the idea, the proposer should create a pull request in order to execute the proposal.
