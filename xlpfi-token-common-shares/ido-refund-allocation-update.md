# IDO Refund Allocation Update

### Refund Amount

A total 520,000 LPFi has been redeemed by LP Finance core team. This amount represents 11.43% of total supply (4,547,299 LPFi at the time of writing).

This amount was originally intended to be burnt, but the core team decided to utilize it for governance purposes and make LPFi even more deflationary.

### Allocation

Total 520,000 LPFi would be allocated as follows.

* **xLPFi - LPFi Liquidity:** 320,000 LPFi (160,000 LPFi burnt to 160,000 xLPFi)
* **xLPFi Staking Pool:** 200,000 LPFi (40,000 LPFi/year)

As mentioned [here](./) this mechanism would allow more xLPFi to be burnt than the emission. Additionally, 320,000 LPFi would be locked in form of xLPFi - LPFi LP permanently, so would not be accounted as an inflated amount.
