# Risks

### LPFi Staking

To unstake LPFi, a penalty is applied (check [here](lpfi-staking-preferred-shares.md#unstaking-penalty) for more info). If a proposal is submitted on LP Finance Governance and the user wants to vote, a loss of funds would occur.

It is important to balance the amount of staked LPFi and xLPFi if you are willing to participate.

### xLPFi Governance

Minting xLPFi to participate in governance does not guarantee 1:1 swap back to LPFi. xLPFi is likely to be traded at a discount on liquidity pools at the most time, so users should be knowledgable on the risks and usage of xLPFi.
