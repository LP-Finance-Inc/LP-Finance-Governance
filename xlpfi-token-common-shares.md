# xLPFi Token (Common Shares)

### Minting xLPFi

xLPFi can be minted by burning LPFi (1:1 ratio). Minted xLPFi is not redeemable and should be swapped to LPFi on market.

### Governance Parameters

Creating proposals and voting is possible on Realms. There are parameters set initially to match the circulating supply and expected engagements.

* **Vote Threshold Percentage**: 10% (At least 10% supply of xLPFi should be used to vote for the proposal to pass)
* **Minimum Token**: 500 xLPFi (At least x500 LPFi is needed to create a proposal)
* **Max Voting Time**: 3 days (Vote would be held for 3 days)

These parameters can be modified if the proposal passes.

### Common Governance Topics

Common governance topics on LP Finance are as follows

* Change LPFi Staking Revenue Distribution Configurations
* Change LPFi Unstaking Penalties
* Onboard zSOL-{token} LP from {x} DEX to zSOL LP Staking Pool
* Change zSOL Stability Fee
* Change Collateral Deposit Fee
* Manage DAO Treasury

If a proposal includes complex logic/changes on the program and LP Finance Development Team does not support the idea, the proposer should create a pull request in order to execute the proposal.
